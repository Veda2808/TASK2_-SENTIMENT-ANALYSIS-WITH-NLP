**This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Specifically, it involves classifying customer reviews into positive or negative sentiments based on their textual content. The key methodologies employed are TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for binary classification. The entire process is developed and demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook, covering the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.**
